Let's practice making a tableView that segues to a detail page.

Inside this repo, you'll find a skeleton project with a ZooAnimal class outlined.

### Step 1:

Create and populate a tableView. The main text should be the name of the animal, the subtitle text should be the classification and the origin and the image should be the image of the animal.

### Step 2:

Create a custom tableview cell that contains an image, and two labels.  


### Step 3:

Create a detail view controller with a large image and all information about the animal on it. When you select a row in the tableView it should segue to the correct detail view. 
Don't forget to pass the object to the detail page in the segue.
Don't forget to embed your TableViewController in a NavigationViewController.

### Step 4:

Use autolayout do make the detail view dynamic for different devices.

### Step 5: 

Use sections, with section headers for the different classification of animal. e.g. a section for mammal, bird, etc
